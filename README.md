## Story
I was fed up with searching for various simplistic/minimalistic wallpapers all over the web or in some shady apps from the App Store.
So I decided to create my own wallpapers, and I felt like there would be more people with that issue, so I created Supersimple.

## Features
* Simplistic/Minimalistic
* Crisp, clean, pixel-perfect
* No annoying watermarks
* Open-source

## Updates
Supersimple will be regularly updated in "batches".
These batches add more wallpaper variations to the library.

## Resolutions
* 750x1334 (iPhone 6, 6s, 7)

(Current only supported resolution, please wait until the repository gets updated with more)
