# Supersimple
A library of simple iPhone wallpapers.

## Story
I was fed up with searching for various simplistic/minimalistic wallpapers all over the web or in some shady apps from the App Store.
So I decided to create my own wallpapers, and I felt like there would be more people with that issue, so I created Supersimple.

## Features
* Simplistic/Minimalistic
* Crisp, clean, pixel-perfect
* Looks decent
* No annoying watermarks
* Open-source

## Supported Resolutions
* 750x1334 (iPhone 6, 6s, 7)

(Currently the library only supports resolutions for the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone 7 (750 x 1334).
Either feel free to use the attached .sketch source file to upsize it, or wait until the repository is updated with more sizes).

## Todo
* Add more shapes/colors
* Support for all iPhone screen sizes
